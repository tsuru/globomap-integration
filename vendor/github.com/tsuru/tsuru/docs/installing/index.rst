Installing
==========

.. note::

    If you want to try tsuru with a minimum amount of effort, we recommend you to use `tsuru
    Now <https://github.com/tsuru/now>`_ (or `tsuru-bootstrap <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-bootstrap>`_, which runs tsuru Now in a Vagrant VM).

    tsuru Now will install tsuru API, tsuru Client, tsuru Admin, and all of their
    dependencies on a single machine. It will also include a Docker node which will
    run deployed applications.

    This gives you a very nice environment for trying out tsuru, but this is not
    the recommended approach for a production environment.

.. note ::
    tsuru client ships with an :ref:`experimental` feature called :ref:`installer`
    that can be used to provision machines on different iaas and install tsuru
    on them.

This document will describe how to install each component separately.
We assume that tsuru is being installed on an Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS 64-bit
machine. This is currently the supported environment for tsuru, you may try
running it on other environments, but there's a chance it won't be a smooth
ride.
